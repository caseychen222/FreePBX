# FreePBX
Stuff I've made for my FreePBX server

In the code are spots for your FreePBX host name (FQDN or IP address), username, and password.

You will need to set up a user from the SQL command line within the FreePBX server and grant select privileges on:

asterisk.ivr_entries
asterisk.ivr_details
asterisk.incoming
asteriskcdrdb.cdr
